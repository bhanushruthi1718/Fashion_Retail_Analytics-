2.Customer driven metrics across three different customer segments or tiers. 
3.Number of orders consumers have made in the website and how long it usually takes for consumer to make a repeat purchase.  Both are integral to understanding the behavior of clients and more importantly are the key metrics that need to be optimized to improve margins
